# POD Integration Issues & Fixes

## 🚨 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Directory Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** POD service was trying to save files to non-existent directories:
- POD Service was looking for: `lists/` directory
- App initialization creates: `user_lists/`, `ratings/`, etc.
- **Result:** "Resource does not exist" errors

**Fix:** Updated POD service file paths to match app folder structure:
```dart
// OLD (broken):
static const String _toWatchFileName = 'lists/to_watch.ttl';
static const String _ratingsFileName = 'lists/ratings.ttl';

// NEW (fixed):
static const String _toWatchFileName = 'user_lists/to_watch.ttl';
static const String _ratingsFileName = 'ratings/ratings.ttl';
```

### **Issue 2: Flawed POD Availability Check** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** `isPodAvailable()` method was broken:
```dart
// OLD (always returned false):
await readPod('test_connection.ttl', _context, _child); // This file never exists!

// NEW (actually checks login status):
final loggedIn = await isLoggedIn();
return loggedIn;
```

### **Issue 3: Poor Error Handling for Missing Files** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Service crashed when POD files didn't exist yet (normal for first-time use)

**Fix:** Added graceful file loading with individual error handling:
- Each file loads independently 
- Missing files are expected for new POD storage
- Better error messages distinguish between "file doesn't exist" vs "POD unavailable"

### **Issue 4: Initialization Logic** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Service tried to load from POD even when user wasn't logged in

**Fix:** Added proper POD readiness check before attempting file operations

## 📁 **Correct POD Directory Structure**

The app now uses this organized structure in the user's POD:

```
/moviestar/data/
├── user_lists/
│   ├── to_watch.ttl      # Movies to watch
│   ├── watched.ttl       # Watched movies  
│   └── comments.ttl      # Movie comments
├── ratings/
│   └── ratings.ttl       # Movie ratings
├── movies/               # (future: movie metadata)
├── tv_shows/            # (future: TV show data)
└── profile/             # (future: user profile)
```

## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### Files Modified:
1. **`lib/services/pod_favorites_service.dart`**
   - Fixed file path constants to use existing app directories
   - Improved `isPodAvailable()` to actually check login status
   - Added graceful file loading with better error handling
   - Enhanced initialization logic

2. **`TESTING_GUIDE.md`**
   - Updated expected POD file locations
   - Corrected log output examples
   - Fixed directory references in testing scenarios

### No Changes Needed:
- ✅ `lib/utils/initialise_app_folders.dart` - Already creates correct directories
- ✅ `lib/utils/create_app_folder.dart` - Already working properly
- ✅ Integration code in `main.dart` and screens - Still valid

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix**

### **POD Login + Enable Storage:**
1. User logs into Solid POD ✅
2. User enables "Use Solid POD Storage" in Settings ✅
3. **Should now work:** Files save to `user_lists/` and `ratings/` directories ✅
4. **Should see logs:** "Successfully loaded user_lists/to_watch.ttl from POD" ✅

### **First-Time POD Use:**
1. Enable POD storage ✅
2. Add movies to lists ✅  
3. **Files created:** `user_lists/to_watch.ttl`, etc. ✅
4. **No more errors:** "Resource does not exist" ✅

### **Cross-Session Persistence:**
1. Add movies with POD enabled ✅
2. Restart app ✅
3. **Data loads from POD automatically** ✅

### **Issue 5: Double Base Path** ✅ FIXED (Latest)
**Problem:** Base path was being added twice, causing incorrect file paths
- POD Service was using: `'$basePath/user_lists/to_watch.ttl'` = `'moviestar/data/user_lists/to_watch.ttl'`
- But `writePod()` automatically adds base path: `'moviestar/data/'` + `'moviestar/data/user_lists/to_watch.ttl'`
- **Result:** Double path: `'moviestar/data/moviestar/data/user_lists/to_watch.ttl'` ❌

**Fix:** Use relative paths only - solidpod functions automatically add the base path:
```dart
// FINAL (relative paths - solidpod adds basePath automatically):
static const String _toWatchFileName = 'user_lists/to_watch.ttl';
// solidpod automatically creates: 'moviestar/data/user_lists/to_watch.ttl' ✅
```

## 🧪 **Ready for Testing**

The POD integration should now work end-to-end:
- ✅ Correct directory structure with full paths
- ✅ Proper POD login detection  
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing files
- ✅ Real-time POD operations
- ✅ Cross-screen integration

**Next Steps:** Test the app with POD login to verify the fixes work!
